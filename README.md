# Portfolio Website

# Notes: 
- The website is not responsive yet. Will work on screen responsiveness after I'm less busy with school. For now, don't view it on mobile yet.
- Want to design a personal logo for the site. 
- Footer is not that great to look at but will improve later on. 
- Best viewed with Google Chrome (fullscreen).

# Libary/Tool:
- ReactJS (ES6)
- CSS 
- Webpack (For bundling)
